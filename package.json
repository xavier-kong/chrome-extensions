  "description": "### Motivations YouTube is one of, if not the most addictive platforms out there. People have complained about being able to quit every single social media platform out there, except for YouTube. The YouTube \"algorithm\" is able to recommend to you video content that would maximize the expected amount of time you spend on their platform. There are already established chrome extensions that are able to hide many of the features that show such recommended videos such as the recommended videos side bar, the home page, the trending page etc. However I quickly noticed that my time wasted on the platform did not drastically decrease after installing the above mentioned extensions. I realized that the \"search bar\" was allowing me to go down time wasting \"rabbit holes\" by letting me search for videos that would provide zero real value to me both knowledge nor entertainment wise. So I decided to create an extension to hide the seach bar from YouTube pages as well as other modifications that I believe drastically reduce time wasted on the site.",
