# My Productivity Chrome Extensions

This GitHub repo contains the source for code for the Chrome browser extensions for me to increase my productivity. While I am a HUGE fan of the platforms I am trying to reduce my interactions with, I personally have an issue with my own over use of such platforms, often to the detriment of my own productivity.

Featured extensions:

-   [Making YouTube Less Addictive](#making-youtube-less-addictive)
-   [Stay Productive](#stay-productive)

As the extension available on the chrome store didn't work. I decided to just make my own...HEAVILY "inspired" by the original.
