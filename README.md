# My Productivity Chrome Extensions

This GitHub repo contains the source for code for the Chrome browser extensions for me to increase my productivity. While I am a HUGE fan of the platforms I am trying to reduce my interactions with, I personally have an issue with my own over use of such platforms, often to the detriment of my own productivity.

Featured extensions:

-   [Making YouTube Less Addictive](#making-youtube-less-addictive)
-   [Stay Productive](#stay-productive)

## Making YouTube Less Addictive

### Motivations

YouTube is one of, if not the most addictive platforms out there. People have complained about being able to quit every single social media platform out there, except for YouTube. The YouTube "algorithm" is able to recommend to you video content that would maximize the expected amount of time you spend on their platform. There are already established chrome extensions that are able to hide many of the features that show such recommended videos such as the recommended videos side bar, the home page, the trending page etc. However I quickly noticed that my time wasted on the platform did not drastically decrease after installing the above mentioned extensions. I realized that the "search bar" was allowing me to go down time wasting "rabbit holes" by letting me search for videos that would provide zero real value to me both knowledge nor entertainment wise. So I decided to create an extension to hide the seach bar from YouTube pages as well as other modifications that I believe drastically reduce time wasted on the site.

### Key Features

-   Hides the search bar on every page that contains the string 'youtube.com' in the URL
-   Redirects to a motivational quote if watching a video that is not part of a playlist (to reduce impulsive watching)
-   Only allow visits during off hours
-   Hide everything except video player while video is playing
